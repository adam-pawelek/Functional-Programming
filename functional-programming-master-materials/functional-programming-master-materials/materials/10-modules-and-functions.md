## **Modules and Functions**
In Elixir we group several functions into modules. We've already used many different modules in the previous lessons such as the String module:

    iex> String.length("hello")
    5

In order to create our own modules in Elixir, we use the defmodule macro. We use the def macro to define functions in that module:

    iex> defmodule Math do
    ...>   def sum(a, b) do
    ...>     a + b
    ...>   end
    ...> end

    iex> Math.sum(1, 2)
    3

In the following sections, our examples are going to get longer in size, and it can be tricky to type them all in the shell. It's about time for us to learn how to compile Elixir code and also how to run Elixir scripts.

&nbsp;
### **Compilation**
Most of the time it is convenient to write modules into files so they can be compiled and reused. Let's assume we have a file named math.ex with the following contents:

    defmodule Math do
    def sum(a, b) do
        a + b
    end
    end

This file can be compiled using elixirc:

    $ elixirc math.ex

This will generate a file named Elixir.Math.beam containing the bytecode for the defined module. If we start iex again, our module definition will be available (provided that iex is started in the same directory the bytecode file is in):

    iex> Math.sum(1, 2)
    3

Elixir projects are usually organized into three directories:

* ebin - contains the compiled bytecode
* lib - contains elixir code (usually .ex files)
* test - contains tests (usually .exs files)

When working on actual projects, the build tool called mix will be responsible for compiling and setting up the proper paths for you. For learning purposes, Elixir also supports a scripted mode which is more flexible and does not generate any compiled artifacts.

&nbsp;
### **Scripted mode**
In addition to the Elixir file extension .ex, Elixir also supports .exs files for scripting. Elixir treats both files exactly the same way, the only difference is in intention. .ex files are meant to be compiled while .exs files are used for scripting. When executed, both extensions compile and load their modules into memory, although only .ex files write their bytecode to disk in the format of .beam files.

For instance, we can create a file called math.exs:

    defmodule Math do
    def sum(a, b) do
        a + b
    end
    end

    IO.puts Math.sum(1, 2)

And execute it as:

    $ elixir math.exs

The file will be compiled in memory and executed, printing *3* as the result. No bytecode file will be created.

&nbsp;
### **Named functions**
Inside a module, we can define functions with **def/2** and private functions with **defp/2**. A function defined with **def/2** can be invoked from other modules while a private function can only be invoked locally.

    defmodule Math do
    def sum(a, b) do
        do_sum(a, b)
    end

    defp do_sum(a, b) do
        a + b
    end
    end

    IO.puts Math.sum(1, 2)    #=> 3
    IO.puts Math.do_sum(1, 2) #=> ** (UndefinedFunctionError)

Function declarations also support guards and multiple clauses. If a function has several clauses, Elixir will try each clause until it finds one that matches. Here is an implementation of a function that checks if the given number is zero or not:

    defmodule Math do
    def zero?(0) do
        true
    end

    def zero?(x) when is_integer(x) do
        false
    end
    end

    IO.puts Math.zero?(0)         #=> true
    IO.puts Math.zero?(1)         #=> false
    IO.puts Math.zero?([1, 2, 3]) #=> ** (FunctionClauseError)
    IO.puts Math.zero?(0.0)       #=> ** (FunctionClauseError)

The trailing question mark in zero? means that this function returns a boolean; see Naming Conventions.

Giving an argument that does not match any of the clauses raises an error.

Similar to constructs like if, named functions support both do: and do/end block syntax, as we learned do/end is a convenient syntax for the keyword list format. For example, we can edit math.exs to look like this:

    defmodule Math do
    def zero?(0), do: true
    def zero?(x) when is_integer(x), do: false
    end

And it will provide the same behaviour. You may use do: for one-liners but always use do/end for functions spanning multiple lines.

&nbsp;
### **Function capturing**
We have been using the notation name/arity to refer to functions. It happens that this notation can actually be used to retrieve a named function as a function type.

    IO.puts Math.zero?(0)       #=> true
    fun = &Math.zero?/1
    &Math.zero?/1
    IO.puts is_function(fun)    #=> true
    IO.puts fun.(0)             #=> true

Remember Elixir makes a distinction between anonymous functions and named functions, where the former must be invoked with a dot (.) between the variable name and parentheses. The capture operator bridges this gap by allowing named functions to be assigned to variables and passed as arguments in the same way we assign, invoke and pass anonymous functions.

Local or imported functions, like is_function/1, can be captured without the module:

    IO.puts &is_function/1          #=> &:erlang.is_function/1
    IO.puts (&is_function/1).(fun)  #=> true

Note the capture syntax can also be used as a shortcut for creating functions:

    fun = &(&1 + 1)
    IO.puts fun.(1)             #=> 2

    fun2 = &"Good #{&1}"
    IO.puts fun2.("morning")    #=> "Good morning"

The &1 represents the first argument passed into the function. &(&1 + 1) above is exactly the same as fn x -> x + 1 end. The syntax above is useful for short function definitions.

If you want to capture a function from a module, you can do &Module.function():

    fun = &List.flatten(&1, &2)
    IO.puts fun.([1, [[2], 3]], [4, 5]) #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

&List.flatten(&1, &2) is the same as writing fn(list, tail) -> List.flatten(list, tail) end which in this case is equivalent to &List.flatten/2. You can read more about the capture operator & in the Kernel.SpecialForms documentation.

&nbsp;
### **Default arguments**
Named functions in Elixir also support default arguments:

    defmodule Concat do
    def join(a, b, sep \\ " ") do
        a <> sep <> b
    end
    end

    IO.puts Concat.join("Hello", "world")      #=> Hello world
    IO.puts Concat.join("Hello", "world", "_") #=> Hello_world

Any expression is allowed to serve as a default value, but it won't be evaluated during the function definition. Every time the function is invoked and any of its default values have to be used, the expression for that default value will be evaluated:

    defmodule Concat do
    def dowork(x \\ "hello") do
        x
    end
    end

    IO.puts Concat.dowork           #=> "hello"
    IO.puts Concat.dowork 123       #=> 123
    IO.puts Concat.dowork           #=> "hello"

If a function with default values has multiple clauses, it is required to create a function head (without an actual body) for declaring defaults:

    defmodule Concat do
    # A function head declaring defaults
    def join(a, b \\ nil, sep \\ " ")

    def join(a, b, _sep) when is_nil(b) do
        a
    end

    def join(a, b, sep) do
        a <> sep <> b
    end
    end

    IO.puts Concat.join("Hello", "world")      #=> Hello world
    IO.puts Concat.join("Hello", "world", "_") #=> Hello_world
    IO.puts Concat.join("Hello")               #=> Hello

The leading underscore in _sep means that the variable will be ignored in this function; see Naming Conventions.

When using default values, one must be careful to avoid overlapping function definitions. Consider the following example:

    defmodule Concat do
    def join(a, b) do
        IO.puts "***First join"
        a <> b
    end

    def join(a, b, sep \\ " ") do
        IO.puts "***Second join"
        a <> sep <> b
    end
    end

If we save the code above in a file named *concat.ex* and compile it, Elixir will emit the following warning:

    warning: this clause cannot match because a previous clause at line 2 always matches

The compiler is telling us that invoking the join function with two arguments will always choose the first definition of join whereas the second one will only be invoked when three arguments are passed:

    IO.puts Concat.join "Hello", "world"        #=> ***First join "Helloworld"
    IO.puts Concat.join "Hello", "world", "_"   #=>   ***Second join "Hello_world"

This finishes our short introduction to modules.
